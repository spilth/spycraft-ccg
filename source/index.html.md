# Welcome to the Great Game

Espionage is a grand shadow play in which every act is an ideological war and every actor carries the fate of nations in his armor-lined briefcase. The greatest among them are silent soldiers of private wars — wars fought behind the scenes for reasons we never truly understand. They lie, cheat, and steal to protect truth, integrity, and security. They kill to save lives. Spies specialize in treachery so no one else has to, and find honor in conviction alone.

The Spycraft CCG brings these anti-heroes to life, in a world where they have outlived their utility as government pawns. What happens when spies strike out on their own to change the world they helped to destroy? How far will they go to save it? Welcome to the first step toward a very different future...

# Victory

When the fate of the world is at stake, knowing your objectives is key. There are two ways to win the game.

- When you successfully complete a mission or prevent your opponent from completing his, you gain
Victory Points from that mission. Any time that you have 20 or more Victory Points, you win the game.
- Whenever a player’s last leader is retired, that player is out of the game. If you are the last player in the game, you win.

# The Priority Directive

Cards will at times contradict the rulebook. When a card contradicts a rule, the card takes precedence.

# The Cards

There are five types of cards in Spycraft: Leaders, Agents, Actions, Gear, and Missions.

## Leaders

Your leaders choose the agent teams that go around the world to complete missions. Because most leaders are skilled operatives themselves, and are often seen in the field, your leaders are also considered agents.

1. **Card Name:** Your leader’s name (or codename).
2. **Expense Rating:** This is the leader’s resources for activating agents and requisitioning his gear.
3. **Skills:** These are the leader’s ratings in the four basic agent skills: charisma, combat, transport, and craft.
4. **Text:** Bold-faced words at the top of the text box are traits, including the leader’s faction — which side of the shadow war the leader is on.
The rest of the text box contains special rules for the leader as well as any special abilities he may have. At the bottom of the text box, some leaders have story text to give you insight into the world of Spycraft.
5. **Level:** Leaders are ranked in level from 1 to 4, representing their importance and power. More powerful
leaders have higher numbers.

## Agents

Agents are the assistants, analysts, soldiers, and spies your leader hires to complete missions.

1. **Card Name:** Your agent’s name.
2. **Expense Rating:** This represents how expensive the agent is for your leader to activate, as well as the resources he has for requisitioning gear.
3. **Skills:** These are the agent’s ratings in the four basic agent skills: charisma, combat, transport, and craft.
4. **Text:** Bold-faced words at the top of the text box are traits, including the agent’s faction. The rest of the text box contains special rules for the agent as well as any special abilities he may have. At the bottom of the text box, some agents have story text to give you insight into the world of Spycraft.
5. **Bravado:** Bravado is found on all cards in your deck. It is used to escape tight situations and go beyond your agents’ normal abilities.

## Actions

Action cards are the tactics your agents use to misdirect, thwart, and destroy opponents.

An action can be used in the Intel phase, or during a Mission. It can also be a React, which is played whenever it says to be played.

1. **Card Name:** The name of the action.
2. **Text:** The text area describes the type of action the card is, the requirements for playing it, and the effects it creates.
3. **Bravado:** Bravado is found on all cards in your deck. It is used to escape tight situations and go beyond your agents’ normal abilities.

## Gear

Gear cards represent the guns, vehicles, gadgets, and special training that agents use on missions.

1. **Card Name:** The name of the gear.
2. **Expense Rating:** This is how expensive the gear is for an agent to activate.
3. **Skill Adjustments:** Some gear gives a bonus (or penalty) to the agent’s skills. If you line up the gear under the agent, you can easily add the bonuses from multiple gear cards.
4. **Text:** The text area describes the bonuses and special abilities that the agent who equips the gear receives.
5. **Bravado:** Bravado is found on all cards in your deck. It is used to escape tight situations and go beyond your agents’ normal abilities.

## Missions

Throughout the game, your team of agents will clash with other players’ agent teams on missions around the world, described on Mission cards.

1. **Card Name:** This is the codename of the mission.
2. **Cover Rating:** This is how much cover against gunfire exists in the mission’s location. Cover helps agents with little combat training from getting hurt.
3. **Victory Point Value:** This is how many V.P. the mission is worth to the mission’s winner.
4. **Mission Description:** This describes which type of mission this is (fight mission, intrigue mission, or chase mission), whether the mission takes place in a public or private location, and the mission’s objectives.
5. **Text:** This describes special rules for the attacking and defending teams while they are on the mission.

# Basic Tradecraft

## Actions

There are three types of actions in Spycraft. Intel actions are played during the Intel phase, Mission actions are played during a mission, and Reacts say in their text when they are played. All actions are played by an agent, and are based on one of the four basic Spycraft skills (charisma, combat, transport, and craft).

After you declare your action, you must use your agent’s skill to perform the action successfully. Actions have a skill target number (TN), which is the minimum skill that the agent needs in the appropriate skill to play that action. The skill target number is listed after the action type. Some actions have a variable target number ("X") — the target number is explained within the text of the action (and is usually based on the skills of the agent being affected by the action). If an action does not list a target number, then it has a TN of 0 — any agent with even the most basic skill can succeed.

*EXAMPLE: An action that reads "__Intel Craft 4:__ Draw a card." is a craft action that may only be played during the Intel phase. The acting agent must have a craft skill of 4 or higher to play this action.*

The more powerful actions in the game have an additional cost to play them beyond meeting the skill requirement. If an action has a second colon, then the cost between the first and second colon must be paid before the action’s effects can occur. If the cost cannot be paid, the action fails.

*EXAMPLE: An action that reads "__Intel Charisma 5:__ Discard a gear card equipped by this agent: Get any card from your deck and put it in your hand." Requires an agent with a charisma skill of 5 or higher to discard a gear card that he has equipped in order to perform the action. If the agent doesn’t have a gear card to discard, the action fails.*

Players are able to change the skill target after you declare the action, but once you pay the action’s costs, card effects cannot change the action’s skill target. If your acting agent cannot meet the changed skill target
of an action, the action fails.

*EXAMPLE: Your agent with a combat of 5 targets an agent who has combat 4 with the action: "__Mission
Combat X:__ Inflict a wound on an agent. The TN is the target’s combat." When you announced the action, you had enough combat to succeed, but your opponent surprises you by activating a gear card on the target that gives him +3 combat. The skill target is now a 7 and your agent is 2 skill points short.*

If your agent’s skill is less than the target number, you may discard one card from your hand to meet the TN.
If the agent’s skill plus the bravado of the discard is equal to or greater than the TN, then the action succeeds and its effects occur. The agent’s skill hasn’t changed; he just used his bravado to succeed!

*EXAMPLE, CONTINUED: Your agent has a combat of 5 and is 2 points short because the action’s new TN is 7. You discard a card from your hand with a bravado of 3. Discarding the card is a cost, so your opponent may not make any further changes to the skill target. With the added bravado, your agent successfully inflicts a wound on the target, even if your opponent plays a new action raising the target’s combat.*

**Intel or React actions may be used only once per turn. Mission actions may be used only once per mission.** Even though a single action can react to a certain event only once, multiple copies of the same card may each react to the same "trigger."

Sometimes the rulebook or a card gives an action to an agent or leader. Actions are considered to be printed on the agent or leader while he has the ability to perform the action. Bonuses and penalties from actions last until the end of the turn unless it says otherwise.

In summary, each action goes through a series of steps that are always followed in order:

1. **Declaring the action** – Point out the card in play or reveal the action card from your hand. Choose the agent who is performing the action and announce the targets for the action.
2. **Pay the costs** – Meet the skill target number and pay any other costs of the action.
3. **Resolve the action** – Effects of the action happen.

## Facedown Cards

In the world of spies, everything is hidden, and deception is deadlier than any weapon. Most cards in Spycraft enter play facedown. Agents and gear enter play facedown, leaders begin the game facedown, and most missions are facedown. When you play a card face down, you declare what card type that it is — but you’re allowed to lie.

*EXAMPLE: You have an action card in your hand that you decide is worthless this turn. You may play it facedown under one of your agents, telling your opponents that it is a gear card. Now they do not know if the agent has a powerful gun, a fast car, or a useless action.*

Facedown cards have no effect on play and are called inactive. Inactive cards may not be targeted with card effects unless that effect specifically states that it may target facedown/ inactive cards. Inactive agents may be assigned to a mission team, but inactive agents on a mission team may be targeted as if they were active agents, and they immediately activate when they are targeted by an action.

The player that controls an inactive card may look at the card at any time, and may activate the card at any time, turning it face-up. When a card is activated, either by its controller or by a card effect, the controller must immediately pay the card’s cost, or the card is discarded without effect (see Card Costs and Activation, below). If an "illegal" card (e.g. an action pretending to be a gear card) is activated or examined, it is discarded.

The top card of any stack of cards is always the "agent card," even if all the cards in the stack are facedown. The cards attached to it are always "gear cards," even if all those cards are facedown.

## Card Costs and Activation

Even powerful spy organizations have limited budgets – only high-level leaders have the resources to hire the top agents, and only top agents are given the best gear. This is represented by the expense ratings on the leaders, agents, and gear. Leaders use their resources to hire agents, and agents use theirs to equip gear.

When one of your agents is activated, your current leader pays the agent’s cost. If your leader’s expense rating is equal to or higher than the agent’s expense rating, the agent is activated without any additional cost. An agent may be activated at any time, as a **React** to any trigger. To activate more expensive agents, you may discard one card from your hand — if your leader’s expense plus the discard’s bravado is equal to or higher than the agent’s expense, the agent is activated. If you don’t pay for the agent’s expense when he is activated, the agent is discarded without effect.

If the agent being activated is a different faction than your leader, the agent’s expense doubles while he is being activated. This is called the "loyalty penalty." You cannot activate an agent from another faction if another player has an active leader from that faction. You do not pay a loyalty penalty for **Freelancer** agents.

Agents activate gear in the same way that leaders activate agents. If your agent’s expense rating is equal to or greater than the expense rating of a gear card attached to him, the gear is activated without any additional cost. Like agents, gear may be activated at any time, as a **React** to any trigger. To activate more expensive gear, you may discard one card from your hand — if your agent’s expense plus the discard’s bravado is equal to or higher than the gear’s expense, the gear is activated. If you don’t pay for the gear’s expense when it is activated, it is discarded. If you activate a gear card that shares the card name or a bold trait (except **"Unique"** and **"Gadget"**), the old gear is discarded.

_EXAMPLE: Your agent has an "Invisible Sportscar" equipped with the **Vehicle** and **Gadget** traits. When your agent activates a "Laser Watch" with the **Gadget** trait, he doesn’t have to discard the Invisible Sportscar, as agents may have more than 1 piece of hi-tech gear. When the agent activates a "Helicopter" gear with the **Vehicle** trait, he must discard the Invisible Sportscar, because he may have only 1 **Vehicle** at a time._

Leaders can also be activated at any time that you have as many (or more) activation tokens as the leader’s Expense rating (_see Leaders, below_).

## The Mission Queue

The 5 mission cards in the middle of the table (_see below for the setup_) are the mission queue. There are always exactly 5 mission cards in the queue. If there are ever fewer than 5 cards in the queue, slide the missions toward the front of the queue to fill any empty spaces, then deal new missions into the back of the queue until it is full. The first two missions in the queue are always face-up. If either of the first two mission cards in the queue is facedown, turn it face up.

# Spycraft Gameplay

# Game Setup

In Spycraft, each player builds one deck (an Agency Deck), and all of the players share a Mission Deck. When you are first learning the game, use the cards in the starter deck you purchased for your Agency Deck. After you learn the game, you will want to customize your Agency Deck with cards you purchase in booster packs or trade with your friends.

Your Agency deck consists of agents, actions, gear, and 4 leader cards. Your Agency Deck must contain at least 50 cards and may not have more than 3 copies of a given card. It may not have more than one copy of any card that has the **Unique** trait. Each leader in your deck must be a different level and from the same faction.

The Mission Deck contains exactly 24 mission cards, one for each time zone. Each mission card has a mission number. The base set contains missions number 1 to 24, and those are the mission cards that make up the Mission Deck used in each game. In the future, as more missions are released, the Mission Deck will change to use a higher range of mission numbers. At any time that you do not have the current set of mission cards, you may download them for free from Spycraft’s official website: www.spycraftccg.com.

Once all of the decks are ready, players pull their 4 leaders from their Agency Decks and place them facedown in a row from lowest level to highest. All of the decks are shuffled, and offered to an opponent to cut. Players then simultaneously reveal their level 1 leaders. Players have a starting hand size of seven cards, which they draw from their Agency Deck. After the Mission Deck is shuffled, deal the top 5 cards into a row to form the mission queue and reveal the first 2 mission cards.

# Playing the Game

Spycraft is played in turns that the players move through together. During a turn, the players have the opportunity to hire agents and gear, go on missions, and attack their foes.

Each turn has two phases, the Intel Phase and the Debrief Phase.

## The Intel Phase

Each turn, the player with the highest total Craft among the agents he has in play is the starting player and goes first during that turn. If there is a tie, determine the starting player randomly amongst those tied. Beginning with the starting player and going clockwise around the table, each player may play one Intel action, or pass. Keep going around the table with players taking one Intel action or passing until every player passes consecutively. When everyone passes, the turn moves to the Debrief phase. Remember that playing a React does not cost you your turn to play an Intel action.

There are a variety of Intel actions available to you:

1. Recruit an Agent
2. Requisition Gear
3. Perform an Intel action on a card in play
4. Play an Intel action card from your hand 5. Brief a leader
6. Discard a Mission
7. Run a Mission

### 1. Recruit an Agent

You need a variety of agents with different skills to complete your objectives and win the game. As an Intel action, your leader may play a card facedown from your hand as an inactive agent. (_See Facedown Cards, above._) You may activate this agent at any time, paying the cost when he is activated (_see Card Costs and Activation, above_). Leaders may do this any number of times per turn.

### 2.Requisition Gear

An agent without his tools is never as effective as the spy with a variety of gadgets to get the job done. As an Intel action, an active or inactive agent may play a card facedown under himself as an inactive gear. (Remember, this card does not need to be a gear card! _See Facedown Cards, above._) Agents may do this any number of times per turn. You may activate the gear at any time, paying the cost when it is activated (_see Card Costs and Activation, above_). If gear is activated on an inactive agent, the agent is activated first.

### 3. Perform an Intel Action

When it is your turn to play an Intel action, you may play one that is printed on one of your active agent, gear, or leader cards. Remember that if a rule or card effect gives an agent or leader the ability to perform an action, it is as if the action is printed on the agent or leader. This includes actions such as the standard Craft action (_see Agent Skills, below_) or actions on the leaders of each faction (_see Leaders, below_).

### 4.Play an Intel Action card

When it is your turn to play an Intel action, you may play an action card from your hand with an Intel action on it.

### 5. Brief a Leader

You start the game with your level 1 leader in play, but you will usually want to activate your more powerful leaders by placing activation tokens on your inactive leaders. Once per turn, your active leader may perform an Intel craft action to place a number of activation tokens equal to his expense rating on your inactive leaders. A leader that you activated this turn may not perform this action. You can activate a higher-level leader any time that the leader has activation tokens equal to or greater than his expense rating. Like agents and gear, leaders may be activated at any time, as a **React** to any trigger (_see Card Costs and Activation, above_).

### 6.Discard a Mission

Missions don’t wait for agents to complete them. Often the window of opportunity is very small, and a smart leader can close that window to keep other groups from completing a mission. As an **Intel Craft** action, your leader may discard the first mission card in the queue if it was in that position at the beginning of the turn.

### 7. Run a Mission

As an **Intel Craft** action, your leader can declare that you are running a mission. The objective of the mission is to complete one mission (or more) on the mission queue. The leader who declares the mission is called the Attacker.

**After you run a mission, you may not perform any other Intel actions this turn — you must pass instead. You may not run a mission if every other player has run a mission this turn.**

These two rules make your choice of when to run a mission very important. If you run a mission too early, you will not be able to build your team of agents and gear while your opponent is improving his agents. However, if you build too much, your opponents will all run a mission and you won’t be able to.

Running a mission creates a phase within the Intel Phase called the Mission Phase. Each mission goes through the same 5 steps:

1. **Mission Planning** — The Attacker declares which agents will go on the mission. This _mission team_ may include your leader, but must include at least one agent or leader. You may include inactive agents on your mission team, but you may not include more than 5 agents (active or inactive) plus your leader. Agents not selected for the mission team are left back at your _headquarters_, or "HQ."

  Declare which mission you are attacking and gather the agents in your mission team along the mission queue next to the mission. If the target mission is facedown, turn it face-up. The mission you choose determines the type of mission, special rules for the mission, victory conditions, and the victory points for completing the mission.

2. **Identify the Enemy** — Beginning with the player on your left, each player has the option to defend against your mission until someone chooses to be the Defender. The player to your right must be the Defender if no other player chooses to. The Defender chooses a mission team in the same fashion. However, the Defender may choose to put zero agents on the team. The mission’s Victory Points go to the Defender if that player stops you from completing the mission’s objectives.

3. **Engage the Enemy** — Beginning with the player with more craft on his mission team (players may want to activate inactive agents they’ve sent on the mission before this is counted), the Attacker and Defender alternate performing Mission actions. Determine first action randomly if there is a tie. Continue back and forth until both players pass consecutively, then move to the next step. Agents and leaders not in a mission team may not perform actions, unless that action would put the agent into a mission team.

  Each mission type has a "standard skill action" (_see Agent Skills, below_) that agents can do in that type of mission (e.g. in a fight mission, agents can use their combat skill to shoot each other). It is important to remember than even though combat skill is most useful in fight missions, Mission Combat actions can be used in any mission unless the action itself says otherwise. The same is true for charisma actions outside of Intrigue missions and Transport actions away from chase missions.

  Sometimes, when missions get dangerous, your leader may want to pull your agents back to headquarters. Your leader can perform the action "**Mission Craft:** Move any number of your agents from your mission team to your headquarters. You may perform this action while in your headquarters."

4. **Mission Goals** — After the Attacker and Defender pass consecutively, figure out if the Attacker has enough skill remaining in his mission team to complete the mission successfully. The objectives is the last thing listed on the Mission Description.

  The objective is listed as a skill and a target number with a plus ("+") symbol in front of it. The Attacker completes the objective and wins the mission if the total of the listed skill in the attacking mission team is equal to or greater than the objective’s target number plus the total of the listed skill in the defending mission team. He should put the mission in a pile to keep track of how many victory points he has collected. If the Attacker does not succeed, the Defender has stopped the Attacker and wins the mission, collecting its victory points.

  *EXAMPLE: Both players pass their mission actions and the teams move to Mission Goals on a "Chase • Public • Combat +2" mission. The Attacker counts up his skill totals to find that he has a total combat of 7. The Defender has a total combat of 3 (most of his agents were run off the road during the chase). The attacker’s combat total of 7 is at least equal to the Defender’s 3 plus the objective’s target number of 2. The Attacker has won the mission, puts the mission card in his stack of completed missions, and is several victory points closer to winning the game.*

5. **Mission Debrief** - If collecting the mission raises a player to 20 Victory points, he wins the game. Otherwise, refill the mission queue. Agents in the Defender’s mission team return to headquarters

  If the Attacker wins the mission, he may declare that he is extending his mission to the next mission card in the queue. This new mission has its objective doubled for each extension the Attacker has made this turn (e.g. if this is his fourth mission, the objective is multiplied by eight!). Once the new mission is targeted, return to mission step 2 ("Identify the Enemy") and resolve the mission normally with the remaining agents in the attacking mission team. The Defender builds a new mission team normally.

  Once the Defender wins a mission or the Attacker does not extend after winning, all agents return to headquarters, and the Intel Phase resumes. Remember that the Attacker may not play any further Intel Actions this turn.

### Debrief Phase

Once all players pass consecutively in the Intel Phase, the turn moves to the Debrief phase. Each player draws five cards. If a player has more than seven cards (the standard hand size), he must discard cards to get down to the maximum.

# Agent Skills

There are four skills in Spycraft: charisma, combat, transport, and craft. An agent’s proficiency with a skill is represented by the skill rating printed on his card. Skills can go up and down during play due to gear and other effects (such as being injured; _see Wounded and "Retired" Agents, below_). Skills that are reduced below 0 are considered to be 0.

Each skill has a standard action that agents may perform. There is a reference card in your starter deck that lists these actions.

### Charisma

Charisma represents the agent’s ability to use his looks and personality for subterfuge and seduction. Charisma is most useful in intrigue missions. All agents may "baffle" enemy agents:

"**Mission Charisma X:** If his is an intrigue mission, target an opposing agent. Until the end of the mission, the target’s skills are 0 and the agent is considered **Exposed**. The TN is the target’s charisma."

If the agent was already **Exposed**, that effect continues at the end of the mission even after the exposure from the Charisma action ends.

### Combat

Combat represents the agent’s skill with firearms and hand-to-hand combat. It’s the ability to hurt the enemy while avoiding being hurt. Combat is most useful in fight missions. All agents may "shoot" enemy agents:

"**Mission Combat X:** If this is a fight mission, wound an opposing agent. If this is a **Public** mission, expose this agent. The TN is the target’s combat or his cover, whichever is greater."

Agents who are not highly skilled in combat can protect themselves using the cover available in their surroundings. An agent’s cover is the cover that the mission provides, plus any bonuses the agent is receiving (as from cover fire, or personal armor).

### Transport

Transport represents the agent’s ability to drive, pilot, or even just run fast in demanding and dangerous chases. Transport is most useful in chase missions. All agents may "evade" enemy agents:

"**Mission Transport X:** If this is a chase mission, target an opposing agent. Move the target agent to his headquarters. The TN is the target’s Transport skill."

From these three automatic skill actions, you can see the basic strategy of each of the three mission types. In fight missions, you wound or even retire opposing agents to gain the skill advantage over their team. In intrigue missions, you use your charisma to "baffle" opposing agents, reducing their skills to zero. Finally, in chase missions, you "evade" opposing agents (such as by running them into barriers), removing them from the chase and the mission.

In each case, you are reducing the enemy mission team’s skill totals.

### Craft

Craft represents the agent’s ability to gather and conceal information.
Craft is most useful during the Intel phase to discover hidden information. All agents may "snoop" facedown cards:

"**Intel Craft 4:** Examine a facedown card."

Facedown cards may not be moved between stacks of cards. During the Debrief phase (_see Debrief Phase, above_), players may rearrange their facedown cards within a stack.

# Wounded and "Retired" Agents

Espionage is a dangerous game, and agents often become wounded. When an agent is wounded, turn him 90 degrees (sideways) to indicate that he is hurt. An agent with one wound is _wounded_ and has a –2 penalty to all of his skills. Since the game represents a single 24-hour period, wounds do not have time to heal on their own, and can only be removed by card effects.

When an agent has two or more wounds, he is retired. A retired agent is dead and removed from play. Send the agent to the discard pile, with his gear.

## Team Size

In the espionage community, large teams are considered unwieldy. You may not have more than 5 active agents (plus your leader) at any time. If you ever have more than 5 active agents, you must immediately retire one of your agents.

You may not have more than 5 agents (plus your leader) on your mission team, whether those agents are active or inactive.

## Exposed Agents

When an agent’s cover is blown, he becomes a target to his enemies and a danger to his colleagues. An agent whose cover is blown is exposed and gains the "**Exposed**" trait. You may wish to mark exposed agents with a token. Being exposed does not impose any automatic penalties, but agents can bring many weapons to bear against an exposed enemy.

Many of the more violent actions (using grenades, for example) will expose your agents when they are used in a mission that is in public. The standard charisma action ("baffling") used in intrigue missions exposes an agent for the rest of that mission. Other card effects can also expose an agent.

# Leaders

You begin the game with four leaders, but only your level 1 leader is active. Your other three leaders are face down and inactive, arranged from lowest to highest level.

Leaders are also considered agents, so any effect that targets, counts, or affects agents includes leaders. Leaders can perform any action that an agent can perform (equipping gear, using combat in a fight mission, and so on). In addition to these abilities and anything printed on their cards, leaders always have a special ability that they receive as part of their training. Each faction’s leaders have a different special ability.

- **Banshee Net:** "**Mission Craft:** Send an **Exposed** agent to his headquarters. This leader does not need to be in the mission team to perform this action."
- **Bloodvine Syndicate:** "**React Craft:** After one of your agents is targeted by an action: Redirect the action to one of your lower-expense agents."
- **The Krypt:** "**Intel Craft:** Examine a mission in the queue. You may discard the mission."
- **Nine Tiger Dynasty:** "**React Combat:** After one of your agents declares a mission action: The action is performed as if the mission were a fight mission instead of the current mission type."
- **Shadow Patriots:** "**React Craft:** After you win a mission that is a different type from the last mission you won: Increase the victory point value of the mission by +2."

These abilities are listed on a card you find in your starter deck. This card is not part of your deck, and is just a reminder of your leaders’ ability.

### Leader Activation

Because leaders have such a critical role within an organization, their activation is different from other agents. There are two ways that leaders are activated:

- When your active leader leaves play
- By accumulating activation tokens

Any time that your active leader leaves play (probably by being retired), your lowest-level inactive leader is immediately activated. This happens automatically and without cost. This can be good because your new leader is more powerful, but remember that if your highest level leader is retired, you immediately lose the game.

The other way to activate a leader is through activation tokens. Using the "Brief a Leader" Intel action, you place activation tokens on your inactive leaders. When an inactive leader has activation tokens equal to or greater than his Expense rating, you may activate him at any time. Your previous leader becomes a regular agent and is no longer a leader. Unlike other costs in Spycraft, you cannot use bravado for the last few points to activate a leader.

# Timing

When more than one player wishes to perform an action at the same time, begin with the starting player and proceed clockwise around the table.

# Targeting

Many actions require you to choose a target or targets. The targets (or potential targets) of an action are stated within the text of the action, and targeting also occurs when a card affects another card in play. If an action is redirected, it must be to another legal target.

For example, if you activate a leader card that gives each of your Faceman agents +1 charisma, the leader targets all of your Facemen when he is activated. When you activate a new Faceman agent, he is targeted by the leader when he is activated.

## Deck Rules

When you search your deck for a card, you must reveal it to your opponents. After searching your deck, shuffle it. When any deck (including the mission deck) runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile into the deck.

## Glossary

- **Activate/Activation:** An inactive card can be activated at any time by its controller. The card’s cost must be paid when the card is activated. Attacker: The mission team that is running the mission is the Attacking team.
- **Bravado:** In moments of great stress and danger, true heroes stand out. An agent can get a little boost to get the job done by discarding a card for its bravado value.
- **Deactivate:** Return a card to inactive (facedown) status.
- **Defender:** The mission team opposing the Attacker.
- **Enemy agent:** An agent controlled by another player.
- **Exposed:** An agent with blown cover. There are many ways to hurt an **Exposed** agent.
- **Extending:** After winning a mission, the Attacker may continue to the next mission in the queue. The difficulty is doubled and the Mission Phase continues.
- **Factions:** The Banshee Net, the Bloodvine Syndicate, the Krypt, the Nine Tiger Dynasty and the Shadow

# Turn Sequence

## Intel Phase

Beginning with the player with the highest total craft, players alternate taking Intel actions (in any order):

1. Recruit – Put an agent into play from your hand.
2. Requisition – Put a gear card on an agent.
3. Play an action on a card in play or from your hand.
4. Brief – Add activation tokens to your inactive leaders.
5. Discard the first mission in the queue.
6. Run a Mission – Begin a Mission Phase (see below).

When all players pass, move to the Debrief Phase.

## Mission Phase

You can’t run a mission if all other players have run a mission this turn. The Attacker targets a mission and names his team, then the Defender names his team. Starting with the team with the highest total craft, alternate taking Mission actions to reduce the opponent’s skill totals. Each mission type has a standard action (see the reminder card in your deck). After both teams pass, determine the winner. If the Attacker wins, he may extend to the next mission. Finally, return to the Intel Phase. The Attacker may not play Intel actions this turn.

## Debrief Phase

All players draw 5 cards, then discard down to 7.
